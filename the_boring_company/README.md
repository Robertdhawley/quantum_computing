# Quantum Computing for The Boring Company: Optimizing Infrastructure

## Abstract

The Boring Company aims to revolutionize tunneling. Quantum computing can optimize routes and materials. This paper assesses these applications and their economic viability.

## 1. Introduction

The Boring Company develops tunneling solutions for urban transport. Quantum computing could enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

## 2. Quantum Computing Overview

Quantum computing excels in optimization and simulation, suitable for infrastructure challenges.

## 3. Applications in The Boring Company

- **Route Optimization**: QAOA for optimal tunnel paths (Farhi et al., 2014).
- **Materials Science**: Quantum simulations for durable tunnel linings (Bauer et al., 2022).
- **Traffic Flow**: Quantum algorithms for underground network simulations (Fox et al., 2022).

**Example: QAOA for Route Optimization**

```python
from qiskit_optimization.applications import Maxcut
from qiskit_algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
from qiskit_optimization.converters import QuadraticProgramToQubo

# Define a simple graph for optimization
graph = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
maxcut = Maxcut(graph)
qp = maxcut.to_quadratic_program()

# Convert to QUBO
converter = QuadraticProgramToQubo()
qubo = converter.convert(qp)

# Set up QAOA
sampler = Sampler()
qaoa = QAOA(sampler=sampler, reps=1)

# Solve the problem
result = qaoa.compute_minimum_eigenvalue(qubo.to_ising()[0])
print(result)
```

This code applies QAOA to tunneling optimization. See [Qiskit Optimization](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/optimization/tutorials/05_qaoa.html) for details.
