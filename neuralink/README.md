# Quantum Computing for Neuralink: Enhancing Brain-Machine Interfaces

## Abstract

Neuralink aims to connect human brains with computers. Quantum computing can accelerate neural simulations and data processing. This paper explores these applications and their costs and benefits.

## 1. Introduction

Neuralink develops brain-machine interfaces for medical and cognitive enhancement. Quantum computing could address computational limits in neural modeling.

## 2. Quantum Computing Overview

Quantum computing offers speedups for simulations and machine learning, relevant to neural data analysis.

## 3. Applications in Neuralink

- **Neural Simulations**: Quantum algorithms for modeling brain activity (Carleo & Troyer, 2017).
- **Device Optimization**: QAOA for designing efficient implants (Farhi et al., 2014).
- **Data Processing**: QSVM for analyzing brain signals (Havlíček et al., 2019).

**Example: QSVM for Brain Signal Classification**

```python
from qiskit.circuit.library import ZZFeatureMap

# Define a feature map for 2-dimensional data
feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(feature_dimension=2, reps=1)

# Example data point
data_point = [0.5, 0.5]

# Assign parameters to the feature map
qc = feature_map.assign_parameters(data_point)

print(qc)
```

This code sets up QSVM for neural data classification. See [Qiskit Machine Learning](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/tutorials/03_quantum_kernel.html) for details.
